# ADR-0031: Runtime-owned delivery state for task delivery

- Status: Proposed
- Date: 2026-10-07
- Scope: task-delivery profiles, handoff, and delivery state

## Context

The `task-delivery` skill coordinates a gated lifecycle (preflight through
post-merge). Its state, which gates passed on which head commit with which
evidence, lives only in the executor's context and in prose reports. A reset
or a new session loses it, evidence cannot be audited, and the handoff is
written by hand.

The Runtime already owns task state (`task:*`), pipeline definitions with
guidance and enforced modes
([ADR-0013](ADR-0013-pipeline-constraints-intersect-action-authorization.md)),
audit, and durable queues. The skill's gates and the Runtime's pipeline stages
are two descriptions of one process and are only related by a prose mapping.

The skill is also deliberately independent of the Runtime
([ADR-0012](ADR-0012-shared-project-guide-and-repository-skills.md) concerns
the separate `ai-office` skill; `skills/README.md` states the independence of
`task-delivery`).

## Decision (proposed)

1. Add a delivery run as Runtime-owned, non-authoritative-for-security state:
   profile, selected gates, per-gate result, and evidence references bound to
   a head commit, recorded through application commands behind the existing
   Runtime IPC. It records and reports; it authorizes nothing. Merge,
   approvals, and controlled actions keep their existing authority.
2. Expose it as `delivery:next` (what the profile requires now, derived from
   the recorded state) and `delivery:record` (record a gate result with
   evidence). The skill uses them when a Runtime is available.
3. Keep the skill usable without a Runtime. Without one, the skill keeps the
   file handoff packet of step 1 and the same gate semantics.
4. A delivery profile selects gates; it does not replace an enforced
   pipeline. When an enforced pipeline governs the task, the pipeline remains
   authoritative and the delivery run is subordinate evidence.

## Alternatives considered

- **Keep everything in the skill and files.** No architectural change, but no
  audit, no cross-session truth, and the handoff stays a convention.
- **Model gates as an enforced pipeline.** One source of truth, but it binds
  runs to assigned performers and ties a portable workflow to the Runtime.
- **Store state in Git (a tracked file).** Portable and reviewable, but it
  pollutes diffs and invalidates the head-bound evidence it records.

## Consequences

- A persistence change: a forward SQL migration, fresh and upgrade tests, and
  an application service and port.
- Daemon and CLI end-to-end coverage through the Unix-socket protocol.
- Two run records (pipeline run and delivery run) must not drift; the relation
  and any deduplication must be settled before implementation.
- The CLI never falls back to an embedded writer. `delivery:validate` is a
  Runtime-routed read and adds no offline path.
- Any caller-local path argument is resolved by the CLI against its own working
  directory and sent as an absolute path; the Runtime rejects relative paths and
  never infers the caller's working directory.

## Open questions

- Is a delivery run a new aggregate, or an extension of a task or pipeline run?
- Which evidence is stored (reference and hash only is the proposal)?
- Does the Runtime reject `delivery:record` for a head commit it cannot see?
