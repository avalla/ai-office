## 1.9.1 — 2026-03-23

### Changed

**Adapter deduplication:**
- Long-form Codex and Claude Code wrappers now render from shared neutral templates in `skeleton/core/templates/skills/`
- `src/build-adapters.ts` now rebuilds the full Codex and Claude Code skill sets from neutral sources instead of mixing generated and duplicated hand-maintained files
- Template-driven wrappers now stamp the current framework version and adapter-specific skill root consistently
- `install.sh` and `update.sh` now consume generated adapter metadata from the neutral manifest instead of maintaining duplicate adapter path tables

### Fixed

- Removed the accidental `autoepoque` agency from the shipped core agency set
- README and setup/build tests now reflect the actual bundled agencies and generated wrapper model

---

## 1.9.0 — 2026-03-23

### Changed

**Generated wrapper layer:**
- The core operational wrapper set is now generated from the neutral manifest: `office`, `office-route`, `office-advance`, `office-doctor`, `office-milestone`, `office-setup`, `office-status`, `office-task-create`, `office-task-integrate`, `office-task-move`, `office-task-update`, and `office-validate`
- Codex core skills, Claude Code core skills, Windsurf core workflows, and adapter instruction files now share that generated source of truth
- Windsurf rule and workflow scaffolding now fits the same modular generation model
- Package versions bumped to `1.9.0` across the framework, website, and slides packages

## 1.8.0 — 2026-03-23

### Added

**Windsurf adapter:**
- New first-party `windsurf` adapter under `skeleton/adapters/windsurf/`
- `AGENTS.md` wrapper tailored for Windsurf
- Workspace rule at `.windsurf/rules/ai-office-workspace.md`
- Reusable Windsurf workflows under `.windsurf/workflows/` for routing, doctor, setup, status, task, milestone, validation, and stage-advance operations

### Changed

**Installer, updater, and doctor:**
- `install.sh` now supports `--adapter=windsurf`
- `update.sh` now detects and updates Windsurf installs using `.windsurf/.version` or the neutral install metadata
- `ai-office doctor` now recognizes the Windsurf adapter and validates `.windsurf/rules/` plus `.windsurf/workflows/`
- CLI validation scans now ignore `.windsurf/` like the other adapter-specific directories

---

## 1.7.0 — 2026-03-23

### Added

**Host-neutral architecture:**
- New `skeleton/core/` layout for the framework engine, templates, agencies, and the canonical `AI-OFFICE.md` guide
- New `skeleton/adapters/` layout with first-party `codex`, `claude-code`, and `base` adapters
- Neutral install metadata at `.ai-office/install.json` with `schemaVersion`, `version`, `adapter`, and `installedAt`

### Changed

**Install and update flow:**
- `install.sh` now supports `--adapter=codex|claude-code|base` and always installs the core guide plus the selected adapter wrapper
- `update.sh` now detects the active adapter from neutral metadata or legacy version stamps and preserves that adapter by default
- `setup.sh` and `create-agency.sh` now resolve agencies from the host-neutral core layout instead of a host-specific skeleton path

**CLI and docs:**
- `ai-office doctor` now detects the installed adapter and validates the appropriate wrapper files for that environment
- README now documents the `core + adapters` model and adapter-aware install/update commands

### Fixed

- Legacy Claude Code installs now update into the neutral metadata model without being migrated to Codex

---

## 1.6.0 — 2026-03-23

**Skills and docs:**
- New `office-task-integrate` skill for Codex and Claude installs
- `office-task-move` skill fallback updated to respect configured branch/worktree isolation
- Branch workflow docs updated to describe opt-in task isolation and explicit integration into the configured UAT branch

### Fixed

---

## 1.3.0 — 2026-03-18

### Added

**Labels support:**
- `$office-task-create` — new `labels:tag1,tag2` argument; `**Labels:**` field added to task file template
- `$office-task-update` — new command to update task metadata (labels, priority, assignee, estimate, deps) without moving the task

**Task history:**
- Task files now include a `## History` section; `$office-task-create` writes the initial `Created in <column>` entry
- `$office-task-move` appends a timestamped `<OLD> → <NEW>` entry to `## History` on every move
- `$office-task-update` appends a `Updated — <changed fields>` entry to `## History`
- `$office-verify` appends verdict and outcome to `## History`

**Discussion phase (GSD-inspired):**
- `$office-route` now runs a two-phase flow: (1) classify the request, (2) ask 4–6 tailored questions before routing and write `.ai-office/docs/context/<slug>.md` with constraints, patterns, and ruled-out approaches; Quick fix requests skip the discussion phase

**Active QA verification:**
- `$office-verify <task-id>` — new command that actively verifies acceptance criteria using auto (tests, typecheck, lint, grep), inspect (code reading), and manual methods; diagnoses root causes of failures; renders an APPROVED or RETURNED verdict; updates the task's `## History`

**Custom agency profiling:**
- `$office-setup` — step 2 replaced: instead of picking from a premade list, Claude interviews you (domain, team, quality concerns, cadence) and generates a custom `.ai-office/agencies/<slug>/config.md` with tailored agent roster, per-agent focus, and handoff rules
- `$office-route` — new pre-check warns if no agency is configured and blocks routing until `$office-setup` is run
- `$office-agency` — simplified to three subcommands: `list` (active roster), `get <name>` (raw config), `profile` (re-run interview independently)

**File version annotations:**
- Modified skeleton command files now include `<!-- ai-office-version: 1.3.0 -->` at the end; `update.sh` uses these annotations to detect per-file staleness

### Changed

- `milestone.md` — `status` command now shows priority breakdown (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW done counts) and lists all labels in use across the milestone's tasks
- `install.sh` — prints available addons with activation instructions at the end of install
- `update.sh` — compares `ai-office-version` annotations per file; falls back to full diff for unannotated files
- `doctor.md` — command count updated to 23; added agency profile check; added `docs/context/` directory check

# Changelog

## 1.2.1 — 2026-03-18

### Added

**`$office-milestone create` — task generation:**
- New optional argument `tasks:yes|no|ask` (default: `ask`)
- After creating the milestone file, the system reasons about the milestone name plus any related PRD/ADR context to suggest 4–12 tasks covering the full pipeline (backend, API, UI, tests, security, docs)
- Each suggestion includes title, assignee (agent-mapped by task type), priority, and estimate
- In `ask` mode with `advance_mode: manual`: presents a table and asks `all | select <numbers> | edit | none`
- In `ask` mode with `advance_mode: auto`, or with `tasks:yes`: creates all tasks immediately
- The milestone file's `## Definition of Done` is auto-populated from the suggested task titles
- Task numbers are auto-assigned sequentially within the milestone

**New commands (3):**
- `$office-run-tests <slug>` — runs `test_cmd` from `project.config.md`, parses runner output (vitest, jest, pytest, go test), appends `## Test Results` with per-suite breakdown and coverage % to `<slug>-status.md`; warns if coverage is below `coverage_min`
- `$office-validate-secrets [path]` — scans the codebase for hardcoded secrets using pattern matching (passwords, API keys, tokens, private keys, AWS IDs, GitHub tokens); allowlists env-var placeholders and test fixtures; shows redacted snippets and remediation advice
- `$office-role <agent-name>` — displays an agent's `personality.md` enriched with stage-specific focus guidance; warns if viewing a non-active agent's role for the current pipeline state

**Base rules (`AGENTS.md`):**
- `skeleton/AGENTS.md` — always-on quality rules installed at `AGENTS.md` in every project; ported and adapted from Windsurf `base-*` + `global.md` + `task-management.md` rule files; covers reasoning & scope control, code quality, TypeScript strict rules, security, git conventions, AI Office workflow, task state transitions, and loop guards

**Opt-in addons (`skeleton/.ai-office/addons/`):**
- `typescript-naming.md` — file naming, identifier casing, boolean/async function prefixes
- `supabase.md` — RLS policies, migrations, Edge Functions, pgTAP patterns
- `bun-monorepo.md` — Bun runtime preferences, workspace protocol, monorepo layout
- `frontend-react.md` — component structure, state management, a11y, performance
- `react-native.md` — Expo conventions, SecureStore, navigation typing
- `mcp-usage.md` — MCP tool preferences and AI Office slash command reference

Addons are activated by copying the contents of `.ai-office/addons/<name>.md` into `AGENTS.md`.

### Changed

- `review.md` — **Technical sector**: added TypeScript-specific checks (`any`, unsafe `as` casts, non-null assertions `!`, `@ts-ignore`), SOLID principle checks (S/O/L/I/D each with concrete detection heuristics); **Security sector**: added systematic secret pattern scan (grep for passwords, API keys, tokens, private keys, AWS IDs) with allowlist
- `scaffold.md` — `status` template now includes a `## Loop Guards` table with `qa_iteration`, `review_iteration`, `uat_iteration` counters initialized to 0
- `advance.md` — step 4 now explicitly reads the `## Loop Guards` table, increments the applicable counter, writes it back to the status file, and blocks with `blocked_reason` when the limit is reached (previously the guard logic was described but not given a concrete read/write procedure)
- `doctor.md` — expected command count updated from 18 to 21; output format example updated to reflect v1.2.0
- `install.sh` — copies `skeleton/AGENTS.md` to `AGENTS.md` (skip if already exists); copies `skeleton/.ai-office/addons/` to `.ai-office/addons/` (skip if already exists)
